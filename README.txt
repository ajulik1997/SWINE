                    ABOUT

SWINE stands for "Slit Width Influence on Neutron
    flux Estimates". It was originally designed to
    see the effect of varying slit widths on the
    flux intensity and resolution. Since then, it
    has acquired many more features, which will be
    detailed below.

                MAJOR FEATURES

- Creates a heatmap of neutron intensity with
    resolution contours for the full range of
    slit 1 and slit 2 widths
- Creates a graph of intensity vs slit 2 widths
    for every resolution
- Supports saving interactive graphs and loading
    them later
- Multicore support, simulations are spread over
    available cores to reduce simulation time
- Sample instrument file is included, but usage
    of your own McStas instrument file is supported
- Slits and sample repositioning is supported
- Recompiles every instrument file automatically
    using McStas compiler and GCC
- Setting a fixed maximum penumbra is supported
- Changing angle of sample is supported
- For most options, default values are available
    for faster entry
- ANSI support for coloured output
- Does not require Python to be installed to run

                    USAGE

00  Script checks whether you are running under
    Windows, if not, it throws and error.
    PLEASE RUN THIS SCRIPT UNDER WINDOWS ONLY

01  Script checks how many cores are on the system
    MORE CORES -> FASTER RESULTS

02  Script checks whether McStas is installed in
    the default path C:\mcstas-##
    PLEASE MAKE SURE MCSTAS 2.4+ IS INSTALLED

03  You will be asked whether to load a previously
    generated interactive plot, or to run a
    simualtion to generate a new one.
    
    Press "L" to load a plot, select this option
    only if you have a ".swine" file to use,
    otherwise press "S"

04  You will be asked whether you want to use the
    default instrument or use your own
    
    For most cases, using the default instrument
    would give sufficient results. The instrument
    is based on ISIS OffSpec. To select this
    option, hit "Y".
    
    If you would like to use your own instrument
    file, please make sure that it contains the
    following:
    
    - a parameter that controls the widths of
        slit 1 and slit 2
    - a parameter that controls the position of
        slit 1, slit 2, and sample
    - a PSD monitor placed at sample position#
    
    If you would like to use this option, select
    "N"

05a If you have selected to use the default
    instrument, the only options you will need to
    enter are the positions of slit 1, slit 2 and
    sample. If you wish to use defaults, you may
    simply press enter without any input
    
05b If you have selected to use your own instrument
    file, you will need to drag and drop your file
    into the script and hit enter. As my script
    does not know this file, you will need to enter
    the names of the McStas parameters that
    controll the positions of slit 1, slit 2 and
    sample, widths of slit 1 and slit 2, and the
    name of your PSD monitor.
    
    After this entry is done, you will need to
    enter the actual positons of slit 1, slit 2
    and sample. Default values are not supported.
    
    Finally, the script checks whether the names
    you entered exist withing the instrument file,
    and throw an error if they don't. (This is
    mostly here just to catch out spelling errors,
    if I didn't do this check the simulation would
    fail later on an waste a lot of your time)

06  The script now starts compiling the chosen
    instrument file into C code, and then into
    binary. The script checks whether the
    compilation succeeded, if it did not, check
    if your GCC compiler is installed properly.
    
07  You will now need to enter a few more things.
    With every option, press enter without any
    input for defaults.

    - The angle of the sample. This is 1.2 degrees
        by default.
    
    - The maximum allowed penumbra. This is 80mm
        default. Even if your simulation requires a
        smaller penumbra, it is a good idea to set
        this value slightly higher for clarity of the
        plot (any penumbra values larger than the
        maximum are trimmed from the plot)
    
    - The number of steps for slit. This is 50 by
        default. For this setting, a grid of 50 by 50
        different slit positons will be generated.
        Higher numbers will create a finer, more 
        detailed plot, but will take much longer
    
    - The number of slits per simulation. This
        setting is for the second simulation,
        and also deafults to 50. For this value,
        50 points will be drawn for every possible
        resolution line
    
    - Number of neutrons per simulation. This
        defaults to 1e6 for the first part of
        the simulation (and 1e7 for the second
        simulation, to avoid line jitter)
    
    - Plot description. This is empty by default.
        Any text here will be inserted into the
        plot title, so it can be identified when
        saved as an image

08  A working directory will be created to store
    temporary files created by McRun. These will
    be later deleted. This process will give an
    error if you do not have write perimission
    in this folder.
    MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WRITE PERMISSIONS

09  The script will now warn you that everything
    is ready and the simulation will begin.
    Press any key to start running simulations.
    This process can take over a few hours and
    it is recommended you do not use your PC
    during this time, as the simulations will
    take 100% of your CPU and are also memory
    intensive

10  After the simulations are finished, a few
    backgroung tasks are performed, such as
    collecting data for plotting, cleaning up,
    and drawing the figure. Should the figure
    fail to maximise automatically, please do
    this manually to increase the clarity of
    the plots.

11  Once the figure is opened up, you may view
    it and interact with it. When interacting with
    the plot on the right, tracing a line will
    give you the slit 2 position and intensity
    for in the bottom corner. When doing the
    same with the left plot, intensity will be
    shown but slit 1 and slit 2 widths will not
    (known bug).

12  Figure is finally saved via pickling to
    preserve the interactivity. This is still
    and experimental feature and may have bugs
    in it. The saved file will be a ".swine"
    file with its name being the timestamp
    of when it was created. You may rename this
    file should you wish to.

on Windows" error:
- Make sure you are not running this script
    on any Linux based OS, Mini-Windows,
    portable Windows (should be supported
    but not recommended), and that your
    Windows is XP or higher (pre-XP may
    still be supported)
- If you are running the script on a virtual
    machine, try running it elsewhere

If you are seeing the "This script onlt works
on Python 3" error:
- Ever since using embedded Python, this error
    should no longer be possible. If you get it,
    please contact me

If you are seeing the "McStas is not installed
in the default directory" error:
- Please make sure that McStas is version 2.4
    or higher and in the C:\mcstas-## directory
- Please make sure you have read access to this
    directory

If you are seeing the "The selected instrument 
file does not use these parameters" error:
- You may have made a spelling mistake when
    typing the parameter names (or PSD monitor
    name)
- Make sure your McStas instrument file has
    all of the paramters necessary (described
    above)

If you are seeing the "An unknown error has 
occured while compiling to C" error:
- Maker sure McStas is in the /bin directory
    and you have access to it
- If you are using a custom instument, make
    sure that every coponent is somewhere in
    /lib before trying to compiler

If you are seeing the "An unknown error has 
occured while compiling to binary" error:
- make sure you have GCC and Strawberry Perl
    installed and accessible
- this is a GCC error with no obvous fixed,
    please contact me to resolve this issue

If you are seeing the "You do not appear to
have write permission in this folder" error:
- Make sure that you have write permissions
    in the directory where SWINE is installed
    and in the directory where your instrument
    is
- Try running as administrator

If you are seeing the "Error maximising window"
error:
- This is because you are using an unsupported
    backend, ignore the error and maximise the
    window manually should you need to
- Since upgrading to embedded Python, this
    error should no longer be possible, if
    convenient please contact me when you see
    this error

If you are seeing an empty figure:
- this may be due to various reasons, try running
    a single McStas simulation with the parameters
    you specified and see if it completes
    successfully
- if you can't find a solution, please contact me

If you get a runtime error or the application ends
unexpectedly:
